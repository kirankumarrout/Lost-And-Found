<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Us</h1>
<p style="font-family: cursive;">Imagine a campus where lost water bottles don't fade into dorm room obscurity, where wayward textbooks embark on grand adventures before returning to their grateful owners, and where that missing charger isn't gone forever.  That's the vision behind this application, your campus-wide, digital lost and found bureau.</p>

    <p style="font-family: cursive;">We understand. College life pulsates with a chaotic energy – sprinting between lectures, late-night cram sessions, and a whirlwind of activities. Misplacing your essentials is just one more hassle you don't need.  That's where we come in!</p>

    <p style="font-family: cursive;">This application isn't just a website, it's a community of responsible, helpful students (that's you!). Our intuitive platform empowers you to take charge of your misplaced belongings:</p>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">Lost Something? The "Report a Lost Item" form is your digital megaphone to the campus. Details matter – be specific about your prized possession and where it was last seen.</p>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">Finder's Keepers? Not so fast! Stumbled upon a mysterious phone? Earbuds abandoned in the library? With a few clicks, you become a temporary custodian, adding it to our database of found treasures.</p>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">The Power of Search: Consider our search bar your personal detective. Narrow down the lost and found listings by item type, location, and even color. Is that your neon yellow water bottle?</p>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">Reunion Time! When there's a match, our system connects you directly. Arrange a meetup, bask in the relief of recovery, and maybe even make a new friend.</p>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">This application is more than lost and found; it's about fostering a sense of shared responsibility on campus. Let's create a community where forgotten items aren't gone for good, and the phrase "Have you seen my…" becomes a rare occurrence</p>
